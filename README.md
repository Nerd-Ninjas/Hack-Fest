## 📌 Theme: Quality Education  

### 🚀 The Problem  
Traditional education methods fail to cater to individual learning styles:  
- **One-size-fits-all** approach: Schools use the same teaching method for all students.  
- **Lack of engagement**: Classes are often boring, leading to a loss of interest.  
- **No personalization**: Some students need extra help, while others need advanced lessons.  
- **Outdated methods**: Rote learning dominates over technology-driven and hands-on activities.  
- **Limited access**: Poor and disabled students struggle to access quality education.
